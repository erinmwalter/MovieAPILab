# MovieAPILab

MVC C# based lab to practice with connecting a SQL Database, creating an API Controller with endpoints 
(we only got as far as connecting the API controller to the back end, so there is no front end, just the
ablity to call the endpoints and get back raw json data, or to use postman for Post, Put, and Delete functionality)
